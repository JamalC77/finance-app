Every growing business eventually faces this question: Do we need a CFO? The answer isn't always obvious, and getting it wrong—either way—can be costly.

Hire too early, and you're paying $200K+ for expertise you don't need yet. Hire too late, and you're making critical financial decisions without proper guidance.

This framework will help you make the right call.

## The Signs You Might Need Financial Leadership

Before discussing CFO specifically, let's identify when you need more financial capability:

### Complexity Signals

**Revenue complexity**: Multiple revenue streams, complex pricing, or significant deferred revenue.

**Entity complexity**: Multiple entities, international operations, or complex ownership structures.

**Funding complexity**: Venture capital, debt financing, or preparing for fundraising.

**Regulatory complexity**: Industry-specific compliance requirements.

### Scale Signals

**Team size**: Generally 25+ employees means more complex payroll, benefits, and financial operations.

**Revenue level**: $3M+ annual revenue typically warrants dedicated financial attention.

**Transaction volume**: High transaction volumes require more sophisticated systems.

### Decision Signals

**Strategic questions**: You're regularly making decisions where financial analysis would help.

**Investor relations**: Investors are asking questions you struggle to answer.

**Operational blindness**: You don't have clear visibility into profitability, cash flow, or unit economics.

## The CFO Options Spectrum

If you've identified a need, you have several options:

### Option 1: Outsourced Bookkeeping + Software

**What it is**: Bookkeeper handles transactions; software provides dashboards and reports.

**Cost**: $1,000-3,000/month

**Best for**: Businesses under $2M revenue with straightforward financials.

**Limitations**: No strategic guidance. Limited to reporting what happened, not advising what to do.

### Option 2: Fractional CFO

**What it is**: Part-time CFO working with multiple clients.

**Cost**: $3,000-10,000/month (varies by hours and complexity)

**Best for**: Businesses $2-20M revenue needing strategic guidance without full-time needs.

**Limitations**: Limited availability. May not understand your business as deeply as a full-timer.

### Option 3: Full-Time CFO

**What it is**: Dedicated finance executive on your leadership team.

**Cost**: $180,000-350,000+ annually (salary + benefits + equity)

**Best for**: Businesses over $20M or with complex financial situations (fundraising, M&A, public company path).

**Limitations**: Significant cost. Challenging to hire well.

### Option 4: Technology + Fractional Support

**What it is**: Software like CFO Line for daily operations and visibility, combined with fractional CFO for strategic decisions.

**Cost**: $2,000-6,000/month total

**Best for**: Businesses $2-10M wanting sophisticated financial visibility without full-time CFO cost.

**Limitations**: Requires good underlying data. Still need human judgment for complex situations.

## The Decision Framework

Ask yourself these questions:

### Question 1: What Do I Actually Need?

Be specific. "Financial help" is too vague. Do you need:

- Day-to-day bookkeeping and AP/AR management?
- Financial reporting and dashboards?
- Cash flow forecasting and management?
- Strategic planning and analysis?
- Fundraising support?
- Board/investor management?
- M&A due diligence?

Different needs point to different solutions.

### Question 2: How Complex Is My Financial Situation?

| Complexity Level | Indicators | Likely Solution |
|------------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Low | Single revenue stream, cash accounting, no debt, no investors | Bookkeeper + software |
| Medium | Multiple revenue streams, accrual accounting, some debt, angel investors | Fractional CFO or tech + support |
| High | Complex revenue recognition, significant debt, VC investors, M&A activity | Full-time CFO |

### Question 3: What's My Budget Reality?

Be honest about what you can afford:

- Under $3K/month: Software + bookkeeper
- $3-8K/month: Fractional CFO or tech + support
- $15K+/month: Full-time CFO becomes viable

Don't stretch beyond your means. An expensive CFO you can barely afford creates more problems than it solves.

### Question 4: What's My Growth Trajectory?

If you're planning rapid growth, fundraising, or significant strategic moves in the next 12-18 months, invest ahead of the need. Building financial capability takes time.

If you're stable and optimizing, current-state solutions may be sufficient.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Hiring Too Senior Too Early

A CFO from a Fortune 500 company may not be right for a $5M startup. Look for relevant stage experience.

### Hiring a Controller When You Need a CFO

Controllers are accounting-focused: closing books, compliance, reporting. CFOs are strategy-focused: planning, analysis, decision support. Know which you need.

### Hiring a CFO When You Need Better Systems

Sometimes the problem isn't lack of expertise—it's lack of data. Fix your systems first; you might find you need less human capital.

### Not Defining Success

What would a successful hire accomplish in year one? Define this before hiring.

## Questions to Ask Fractional CFO Candidates

1. What size and type of companies have you worked with?
2. How do you structure your engagement (hours, deliverables)?
3. What tools and systems do you use?
4. Can you share examples of strategic impact you've had?
5. How do you handle situations requiring more time than contracted?
6. What happens if we outgrow fractional support?

## Questions to Ask Full-Time CFO Candidates

1. Describe a situation where you helped a company at our stage.
2. How do you balance strategic work with operational finance?
3. What financial systems and processes would you implement first?
4. How do you communicate financial information to non-finance leaders?
5. What's your experience with [your specific needs: fundraising, M&A, etc.]?
6. What would you want to accomplish in your first 90 days?

## The CFO Line Perspective

We built CFO Line because we saw too many businesses stuck between inadequate bookkeeping and unaffordable CFOs.

Our approach: Give businesses sophisticated financial visibility through technology, so they can operate at a higher level without full-time CFO costs. Many of our clients combine CFO Line with occasional fractional CFO check-ins for strategic decisions.

## Making Your Decision

Here's a simple flowchart:

1. **Revenue under $2M, simple financials?** → Start with bookkeeper + software like CFO Line.

2. **Revenue $2-10M, growing, some complexity?** → CFO Line + fractional CFO for strategic guidance.

3. **Revenue $10-20M, significant complexity, or fundraising?** → Evaluate fractional vs. full-time based on hours needed.

4. **Revenue $20M+ or complex corporate structure?** → Likely time for full-time CFO.

The right answer depends on your specific situation. The wrong answer is doing nothing while financial blindspots compound into real problems.
