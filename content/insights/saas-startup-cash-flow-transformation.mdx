When TechFlow Solutions came to us, they were like many fast-growing SaaS startups: strong MRR growth, happy customers, and perpetually running out of cash. Their founder, Sarah, described it perfectly: "We're growing 20% month-over-month, but I never know if we can make payroll."

## The Problem

TechFlow had achieved product-market fit. Their customer acquisition was working. But underneath the growth metrics, three critical issues were draining their cash:

**1. Misaligned Payment Terms**
They were paying vendors Net 30, but offering customers Net 60. Every new enterprise deal actually made their cash position worse in the short term.

**2. Invisible Burn Rate**
Without real-time financial visibility, they didn't realize that their AWS costs had grown 340% while revenue grew 180%. The unit economics were underwater.

**3. No Cash Flow Forecasting**
Financial decisions were made by checking the bank account. There was no model predicting when cash would run low.

## The CFO Line Approach

We implemented a three-phase transformation over 90 days.

### Phase 1: Immediate Stabilization (Days 1-30)

First, we needed to stop the bleeding. We:

- Renegotiated vendor terms to Net 45 and 60 where possible
- Shifted new contracts to annual prepayment with 10% discounts
- Identified $14,000/month in unused SaaS subscriptions

The impact was immediate. Within 30 days, TechFlow went from 2 weeks of runway to 6 weeks.

### Phase 2: Systems Implementation (Days 31-60)

With breathing room secured, we built the financial infrastructure:

- Connected QuickBooks to CFO Line for real-time dashboards
- Created department-level P&L visibility
- Built a 13-week rolling cash flow forecast
- Established monthly financial review cadences

For the first time, Sarah could see exactly where money was going and when.

### Phase 3: Strategic Optimization (Days 61-90)

With visibility in place, we could make strategic decisions:

- Identified that their $99/month tier had negative LTV and raised pricing
- Shifted from month-to-month to annual contracts (67% of new deals)
- Restructured the sales comp to incentivize annual prepayments

## The Results

After 90 days:

- **Cash runway**: 2 weeks → 6 months
- **Gross margin**: 54% → 71%
- **Annual contract value**: 23% → 67% of revenue
- **Time spent on financial admin**: 15 hours/week → 2 hours/week

Sarah told us: "I finally feel like I'm running the business instead of the business running me. I can think about growth instead of survival."

## Key Takeaways for SaaS Founders

**1. Cash flow is not the same as profitability.** You can be profitable on paper and still run out of cash. The timing of money in vs. money out matters enormously.

**2. Payment terms are negotiable.** Most founders accept default terms without question. Vendors expect negotiation, especially with growing customers.

**3. Visibility enables decisions.** TechFlow's problems weren't mysterious—they just couldn't see them. Once we had real-time data, the solutions became obvious.

**4. Annual contracts change everything.** For SaaS companies, shifting from monthly to annual billing has a massive impact on cash flow and reduces churn as a bonus.

## Is Your Startup in a Similar Position?

Many growing companies face exactly these challenges. The good news is that with the right systems and strategy, cash flow problems are solvable—often faster than founders expect.

CFO Line helps SaaS companies and service businesses get real-time financial visibility without hiring a full-time CFO. If you're growing but always feel cash-strapped, we should talk.
