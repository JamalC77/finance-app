Here's a sobering statistic: **82% of small businesses fail due to cash flow problems**. Not lack of customers. Not bad products. Cash flow.

The good news? Most cash flow mistakes are avoidable once you know what to look for.

## Mistake #1: Confusing Profit with Cash

Your P&L says you made $50,000 last quarter. Great! But your bank account is nearly empty. How?

**Profit ≠ Cash**

Revenue is recognized when you invoice, but cash only arrives when customers pay. If you have $100,000 in outstanding receivables, that's profit on paper — not money you can spend.

**The fix:** Track your cash flow separately from your P&L. Know your **cash conversion cycle** — how long it takes from spending money to getting it back.

## Mistake #2: Not Forecasting Cash Flow

Most business owners check their bank balance and hope for the best. That's not a strategy.

Without a cash flow forecast, you can't:
- Plan for slow seasons
- Time large purchases
- Know when to push collections
- Avoid surprise shortfalls

**The fix:** Build a 13-week rolling cash flow forecast. Update it weekly. Tools like CFO Line can automate this using your QuickBooks data.

## Mistake #3: Extending Too Much Credit

You want to be customer-friendly, so you offer Net 30 terms. Or Net 60. Before you know it, you're essentially a bank for your customers.

Meanwhile, your vendors want payment in 15 days.

**The fix:**
- Tighten payment terms where possible
- Offer early payment discounts (2/10 Net 30)
- Invoice immediately — don't wait
- Follow up on overdue invoices within 24 hours

## Mistake #4: Growing Too Fast

This sounds counterintuitive, but rapid growth can kill your cash flow.

Here's why: You need to **spend money before you earn it**. More inventory. More staff. More marketing. By the time revenue catches up, you've run out of cash.

**The fix:**
- Model the cash impact of growth before committing
- Secure a line of credit *before* you need it
- Consider milestone-based growth instead of all-at-once expansion

## Mistake #5: Ignoring Seasonal Patterns

If your business has any seasonality (and most do), you need to plan for it.

A landscaping company that doesn't save during summer will struggle in winter. A retailer that doesn't stock up for Q4 will miss the holiday rush.

**The fix:**
- Analyze at least 2 years of historical data
- Identify your high and low seasons
- Build cash reserves during good months
- Adjust spending before slow periods hit

## The Real Solution: Visibility

All of these mistakes share a common root cause: **lack of visibility into your finances**.

When you can see:
- Where your cash is going
- When payments are coming in
- What your runway looks like

You can make proactive decisions instead of reactive ones.
