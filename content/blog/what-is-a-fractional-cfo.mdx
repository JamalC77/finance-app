If you've ever wished you had a financial expert on your team but couldn't justify the cost of a full-time CFO, you're not alone. That's where a **fractional CFO** comes in.

## What Is a Fractional CFO?

A fractional CFO is a part-time or contract Chief Financial Officer who provides high-level financial strategy and guidance to businesses on a flexible basis. Instead of paying a full-time salary (often $200,000+ annually), you get executive-level financial expertise for a fraction of the cost.

Think of it as having a seasoned financial expert in your corner without the full-time commitment.

## What Does a Fractional CFO Do?

A fractional CFO typically handles:

- **Financial Strategy** — Developing long-term financial plans aligned with your business goals
- **Cash Flow Management** — Ensuring you have enough runway and optimizing working capital
- **Financial Reporting** — Creating meaningful reports that drive decision-making
- **Budgeting & Forecasting** — Building accurate projections to plan for growth
- **Fundraising Support** — Preparing for investor meetings and managing due diligence
- **Tax Optimization** — Identifying strategies to minimize tax burden legally

## When Does Your Business Need a Fractional CFO?

Here are common signs it's time to bring in fractional CFO support:

1. **You're spending too much time on finances** instead of running your business
2. **Cash flow is unpredictable** and you're not sure why
3. **You're preparing for fundraising** or a major financial event
4. **Growth is outpacing your financial systems** and processes
5. **You need strategic guidance** but can't afford a full-time CFO

## Fractional CFO vs. Bookkeeper vs. Accountant

| Role | Focus | When You Need Them |
|------|-------|-------------------|
| **Bookkeeper** | Recording transactions | Day-to-day financial records |
| **Accountant** | Tax compliance, financial statements | Tax season, audits |
| **Fractional CFO** | Strategy, forecasting, optimization | Growth planning, major decisions |

A fractional CFO doesn't replace your bookkeeper or accountant — they work alongside them to provide the strategic layer your business needs.

## How Much Does a Fractional CFO Cost?

Fractional CFO services typically range from **$1,000 to $10,000 per month**, depending on:

- Hours needed per month
- Complexity of your business
- Scope of services required

Compare this to a full-time CFO salary of $200,000-$400,000+ per year, and the value becomes clear.

## Getting Started with Financial Analytics

Before bringing on a fractional CFO, it's smart to get your financial data organized. Tools like **CFO Line** help you:

## The Bottom Line
